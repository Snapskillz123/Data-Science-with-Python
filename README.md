# Data-Science-with-Python
My basic tutorial for Data Science using python.
The Pandas intro file uses this database: https://github.com/KeithGalli/pandas
To download the file, open the file raw and then right click on the new page to save, and save it as a CSV file.
I used this video parallelly for this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg
